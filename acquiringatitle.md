# how to take over a title from another publisher?

## Warning
There are cases where the title ownership has to be transferred with CrossRef, **even if AUP is already the owner** of the title.

This may happen when a title is published on a third party online platform, and that the platform registers the DOIs for the title **under the name of the platform owner**. In that case, CrossRef registers the platform owner as the owner of the title, even if it is really AUP (or anyone else). 

So in those cases, too, **the ownership needs to be transferred** with CrossRef.

Don't ask me how we know this ðŸ™„
