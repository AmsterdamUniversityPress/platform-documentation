# SFTP

Often called "FTP" but really a different thing.

## users
There are multiple users. Each user has access only to _their_ folders. I don't know if there is an admin user that can see all.

## instances
There are instances for content and for suppmements. Both for QA and PROD. I don;t know if there are more.

## distribution
[Distribution](distribution.md) also uses SFTP. [Edify](edify.md) uploads metadata or content to the SFTP of distribution partners. The site admin can specify who these are.
