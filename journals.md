# Journals

- have [ISSNs](issn.md). Print and online have their own ISSN.
- have articles
- articles may be grouped into issues and volumes; out-of-issue articles exist too, called "fast track" in our case
- articles have [DOIs](doi.md)
- are uploaded to [Edify](edify.md) via the [SFTP](sftp.md). Usually per issue (unless fast track)
- upload format is [JATS](jats.md). Sometimes the JATS only contains the metadata, sometimes also the fulltext (i.e. the textual contents of the article)
- almost always, a PDF of the article is included
- articles can have [[supplements](supplements.md)
