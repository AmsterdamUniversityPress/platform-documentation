# Transfer Title Ownership with CrossRef

This is about what to do when AUP acquires a new title, for example a journal. This process has many steps and this page looks at only one of them: how to let CrossRef know that the title now has a new owner, so that the DOI registration is handled succesfully and there are no [problems](doiregistrationproblems.md).

So, I sent them en email and they said the following:

## official CrossRef response
We enforce a concept of ownership for the titles that are registered with Crossref. When the first DOI for a title is registered with us by a member, this creates a title record in our system. This title record ties the title to the prefix belonging to that member. The member who owns that prefix is then the only member allowed to create new DOIs for content belonging to that title (or update the metadata on existing DOIs for that title).
 
If that title is then acquired by a member with a different prefix, we have the option to transfer ownership of that title in the Crossref system to the other member's prefix, but we need a title transfer notification to confirm that the disposing publisher approves the move.]
 
The title you mentioned is currently owned by (`<insert disposing publisher name>`) in the Crossref system. We need title transfer notification to confirm that they are happy with the transfer. There are several different ways to do this.
 
### Option 1 - preferred option
If a title transfer has been posted to the [Enhanced Transfer Alerting Service](https://journaltransfer.issn.org/) (ETAS), let us know and weâ€™ll proceed with the transfer without further confirmation.
 
### Option 2
If you don't participate in Transfer (ETAS), please send member@crossref.org confirmation that the disposing publisher is aware of and agrees with the ownership transfer. The confirmation may be a forwarded email from the disposing publisher to the acquiring publisher acknowledging the transfer. The forwarded email must contain the original sender details.
 
### Option 3
Alternatively, if there is a notice on the disposing publisher's website confirming the move, that works too. 
 
Whichever option you use, please be specific about what is being transferred - include ISSNs, ISBNs, and when you need the transfer to occur (if applicable). Do be specific about which prefix the title is being transferred to, as some publishers have more than one prefix.
 
###  Important issue to discuss with the disposing publisher
Before the transfer, it's important to check that all displayed DOIs using the disposing publisher's prefix have definitely been successfully registered with us. 
 
If, for example, the disposing publisher has DOIs on their own prefix displayed on their website for their latest issue, but they haven't yet registered these DOIs with Crossref, that would cause a problem. As soon as we transfer ownership of the title to the acquiring publisher, the disposing publisher will no longer be able to register any new DOIs on the disposing publisher prefix. And obviously, as those DOIs have already been displayed on a website, it's vital that they have been registered and actually work!
 
So in advance of sending us the title transfer request, make sure to get confirmation from the disposing publisher that they have definitely successfully registered all DOIs for this title that have already been displayed on their site.
 
### Use of existing DOIs
After the transfer is complete, it's vital that your organisation doesn't register new DOIs for content that already has a DOI registered by the original publisher. Once a DOI has been registered for an item, that DOI needs to remain the persistent identifier for that item - forever. Registering new DOIs for content that already has DOIs contravenes clause 2 h 3 of the Crossref membership [terms](https://www.crossref.org/membership/terms/). Your organisation should continue to display and use the existing DOIs, despite the fact that they aren't on your prefix. Don't worry - if we do a full title transfer, you'll then be able to update the metadata on these DOIs, even though they aren't on your prefix. It's our expectation that your platform will be able to accommodate this.
