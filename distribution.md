# Distribution

The [Edify](edify.md) site admin can set up distribution for content and/or metadata.

Currently the following distributiuon channels are set up:

  - CrossRef
  - Legal Ingelligence
  - Portico
  - ??

## 3rd party distribution supported by Edify

- EBSCO
- Scopus
- Crossref
- Kudos
- OCLC
- ExLibris (CDI/Primo/Summon)
- CEPIEC
- Portico

## tip
- resaving an issue retriggers the distribution of that issue. (Editing and then saving an issue is something the site admin can do). Simply resaving an article does _not_ trigger distribution. (This at least, is the current configuration of the AUP Edify instance).
