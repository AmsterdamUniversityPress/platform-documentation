# How to create a new journal?

Navigate to the homepage of the parent content item for the content you wish to create. For example, if you want to create a new Ahead of Print article for a journal, please go to the journal homepage. If you want to create a new book or journal please go to the homepage of the publisher of that book or journal. Do as follows:

1. login as site admin
2. go to the home page of the publisher (= imprint) of the new journal. For AUP, that would be `/content/aup`
3. hover over the left side tools menu and click "Create new journal"
4. fill in the modal (= large popup)
5. the ID for a journal is journals/<ISSN>` **and not simply `<ISSN>`**!

## some context

"Creating a new journal" is one of many "create a new ...". For example , it is possible to create a new journal issue or new journal article. In that case, you go to the home page of the journal and then do as described above.

Creating a new book works in the same way.

## oops I made a mistake
Did you create an item with some sort of error in  it? Edit the journal and correct it. If that is not possible, delete it and create it again. Keep in mind the following. 

If you are simply removing a few articles without intending to delete the issue itself, then you don't need to delete the issue. If you want to get rid of the entire issue itself, then you need to delete the issue and its articles.Â 

Please note that in general, if content identifiers i.e. URLs are changing then it can impact aspects such as access licenses for the content  through subscriptions and ecommerce purchases because the licenses are tied to the content URLs.
