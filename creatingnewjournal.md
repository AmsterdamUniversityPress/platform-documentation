# How to create a new journal?

Navigate to the homepage of the parent content item for the content you wish to create. For example, if you want to create a new Ahead of Print article for a journal, please go to the journal homepage. If you want to create a new book or journal please go to the homepage of the publisher of that book or journal. Do as follows:

1. login as site admin
2. go to the home page of the publisher (= imprint) of the new journal. For AUP, that would be `/content/aup`
3. hover over the left side tools menu and click "Create new journal"
4. fill in the modal (= large popup)
